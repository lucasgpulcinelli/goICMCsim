## üìù Overview
This program is a simulator for the [ICMC architecture](https://github.com/simoesusp/Processador-ICMC/). It features several upgraded functionalities compared to the C++ simulator, including:

- A resizable window and fullscreen capability.
- An instruction scroll to view all instructions and data being modified in real-time.
- Ability to edit the stack pointer and program counter directly.
- Enhanced error handling: the simulator will halt and indicate errors to the programmer.
- Improved parsing of MIF files, adhering strictly to syntax definition and providing detailed error messages.
- Capability to change character mapping MIF during runtime (without resetting).
- Shortcuts that do not rely on keys that may not be present on laptop keyboards (e.g., insert, home, and end keys).
- Support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üíª Installation
If you prefer not to compile anything, you can download a precompiled binary for your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/lucasgpulcinelli/goICMCsim/releases).

## üöÄ Usage
To get started, add a program to run and test it. You can specify MIF files in the ICMC architecture format in the command line or use the file -> open code/char MIF menu. Always specify a char MIF to ensure proper output of characters.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile from Source Code
1. Install a recent version of Go (at least 1.13) from [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).
2. Install Git and a C compiler (on Windows, use MinGW).
3. On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, install `libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev`; on Fedora and Red Hat-based systems, install `libX11-devel libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel mesa-libGL-devel libXi-devel libXxf86vm-devel`.
4. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run `go build .` to compile and `./goICMCsim` to start an empty processor. Use `--help` to see command line options.
6. Optionally, you can install directly into `$GOPATH/bin` with `go install github.com/lucasgpulcinelli/goICMCsim@latest`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Add/Modify Instructions in the Simulator
To add or modify instructions:
1. Choose an opcode for your instruction.
2. Add it to the constants list in `processor/Instruction.go`.
3. Add your instruction data to the `AllInstructions` list in the same file, including the opcode, mnemonic string, instruction size, and execution function.
4. Implement the execution function. See the example in the [documentation](docs/README.md/#go-icmc-simulator-documentation) for details.

## ü§ù Contributing
An open-source project is never complete. You can contribute by:

- [Submitting bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/lucasgpulcinelli/goICMCsim/issues).
- Reviewing [source code changes](https://github.com/lucasgpulcinelli/goICMCsim/pulls).
- [Testing on macOS](https://github.com/lucasgpulcinelli/goICMCsim/labels/macOS%20test) and helping maintain compatibility on all platforms.
