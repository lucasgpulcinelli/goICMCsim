## 🤝 Contributing to the Documentation

Just as an open-source project is never complete, neither is its documentation. Here's how you can contribute:

- **Fix Typos or Grammatical Errors**: Spotted a typo or a grammatical mistake? Feel free to correct it! Every little improvement counts.

- **Improve Clarity or Organization**: Found a section that could be explained better? Want to reorganize the content for better flow? Your input is invaluable in making the documentation easier to understand.

- **Add Missing Information or Sections**: Is there something important missing from the documentation? Don't hesitate to add it! Your contributions help make the documentation more comprehensive.

- **Update Outdated Information**: Has something changed since the documentation was last updated? Help keep it current by updating outdated information.

### ⚠️ Keep our docs running smoother than a well-tuned simulator

To ensure that the documentation remains well-structured and easy to navigate, please follow these guidelines:

1. **One Topic Per File**: When adding new documentation content, create a new file for each topic or section. This helps keep the documentation organized and focused.

2. **Update Table of Contents**: After creating a new file or adding a new topic to an existing file, don't forget to update the table of contents in the `README.md` file. This makes it easier for users to find the information they need.

3. **Label Pull Requests**: When creating a pull request for documentation changes, please add the `documentation` label to the pull request. This helps maintainers quickly identify and review documentation-related changes.

Ready to make a difference in the documentation? Awesome! Your contributions are greatly appreciated and help make the GO ICMC Simulator even better. Thanks for being part of the documentation improvement team! 🎉
